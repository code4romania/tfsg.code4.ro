    text: "We identify problems through a clear workflow and methodology. We take them into the Civic Lab, our digital solutions generator where a team of researchers, UX specialists and experts in various fields build functional prototypes for future civic apps. Once this process is over, these solutions are ready for development so they end up here, in the Tech for Social Good program. This is where the magic happens."

But there’s strength in numbers and if we all work together we can work towards fixing society’s problems. For us. For your city. For Romania."
