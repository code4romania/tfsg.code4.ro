We take them into the Civic Lab, our digital solutions generator where a team of researchers, UX specialists and experts in various fields build functional prototypes for future civic apps. Once this process is over, these solutions are ready for development so they end up here, in the Tech for Social Good program. This is where the magic happens."

But there’s strength in numbers and if we all work together we can work towards fixing society’s problems. For us. For your city. For Romania."

As the name says, our mission is to write code in order to make Romania the country we all want. That’s why Tech for Social Good is Code for Romania’s flagship program, the place where we buckle down and develop tech solutions for societal problems. Tech for Social Good has been awarded the best NGO program award at the prestigious 2018 CIvil Society Gala.
