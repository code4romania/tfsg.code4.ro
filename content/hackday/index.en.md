If you can contribute your time, knowledge and talet to building digital sollutions for Romania, alongside us, come meet us during a new Hack Day edition, which we're hosting both in person as well as online, in a few of the cities we gather in this month. 

Take part in the change! At this time, our community has already proven that it can help tens of millions of Romanian citizens. Alongside you, **we can** build even more. Make your own contribution to one of the Tech for Social Good projects.
