Join us on the 20th of April for our fourth monthly Code for Romania Hack Day for 2019. If you’re in Bucharest, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca or Iași you can participate in-person at one of the Code for Romania local community events. Bring your laptop, get connected and start coding for one of the apps that will change Romania for the better! If you can’t join us in person in one of the four cities you can always join us online and work from home or from your favorite coffee shop!

**Super important!** *HackDay #4* is a very special edition:

* First of all, as you can see, it will take place in the third weekend of the month so that we don't jeopardize the Easter vacation :)
* Second, it is our birthday, therefore we have a special schedule in place. We will celebrate our third anniversary together and we are preparing a very interesting day for you. We will start at 10 am, as usual, but there will be many surprises in store and new projects will enter development.
