If you can contribute your time, knowledge and talet to building digital sollutions for Romania, alongside us, come meet us during a new Hack Day edition, which we're hosting both in person as well as online, in a few of the cities we gather in this month. 

Take part in the change! At this time, our community has already proven that it can help tens of millions of Romanian citizens. Alongside you, **we can** build even more. Make your own contribution to one of the Tech for Social Good projects.

You can only attend our events in person if:

* you have been fully vaccinated (and 10 days have passed since you completed the full vaccination scheme),
* or you provide a negative RT-PCR test taken 72 hours before the event at most 
* or you provide a negative fast antigen test taken 24 hours before,
* or you are in the period between the 15th and the 90th day after confirmation of SARS-CoV2 infection, as evidenced by medical documents (positive RT-PCR test at the date of diagnosis, discharge note, test to show the presence of antibodies performed up to 14 days before the event).

Documents (printed or electronic) will be checked at entry.
