## Built with

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) and everything else listed in [package.json](package.json).

## Deployment

The static website is currently deployed on Vercel. All the submission processing happens on a serverless function and data is stored through Google Forms.

### Configuration

Edit the copy in [`content/`](content/), the form in [`function/form.json`](function/form.json) and other params in [`config.yml`](config.yml). The form data needs to be mapped to Google Forms' specific `entry.id` format in [`function/map.json`](function/map.json).

The handler expects the following environment variables:

- `CORS_DOMAIN` – Domain to allow requests from.
- `FORM_ID` – Google Form ID.

### Building

```
npm install
npm run production
hugo
```
